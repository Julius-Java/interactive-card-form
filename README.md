## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project took me a while because I was trying to work around the input validation process without involving any third party form validation package, it was long but I loved the fact that I was able to work around it without any library.

### Continued development

I would like to improve on following best practices and conventions such that my codebase would be understood by any other developer without hassles
